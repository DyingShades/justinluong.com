  Dr. Luong is an Assistant Professor of Rangeland Resource Science in the Forestry, Fire, and Rangeland Department at Cal Poly Humboldt, where he works with rangeland ecosystems, particularly in conservation and ecological restoration of California habitats, focused but not limited to grasslands with direct land manager engagement. His research interests center around climate-ready and invasion resistant restoration practices and incorporating management perspectives to understand restoration outcomes. Dr. Luong is particularly dedicated to promoting multi-use landscapes that balance range productivity and conserve native plant biodiversity. Dr. Luong completed his Bachelor's at the University of California (UC) Santa Barbara, and worked as an undergraduate researcher in the D'Antonio lab. He earned his PhD at UC Santa Cruz working with Dr. Michael Loik and Dr. Karen Holl in the Environmental Studies Department and worked as a USDA postdoctoral researcher at UC Davis with Dr. Jennifer Funk. Prior, Dr. Luong worked as a restoration coordinator at The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. Dr. Luong actively currently contributes to the broader conservation community through various leadership positions in various professional societies and advisory committees and serves as a board member and the Science and Education Committee Chair of the California Native Grassland Association. Dr. Luong is deeply invested in mentorship and actively fosters the growth of aspiring ecologists and works to train undergraduate and masters students. My favorite grasses are <em>Festuca californica</em> and <em>Danthonia californica</em>.
