PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM NO LONGER ACCEPTING PH.D. STUDENTS AT UCB, as I am planning to go emerita in the next couple of years. However, I plan to continue my research and am still willing to serve on graduate student committees at UCB or other universities. I am also willing to host visiting graduate students or researchers for stays at UCSC if you have funding.  If that is the case, please send me a detailed email about the proposed timing and plan for your visit. If you are an international student who wants to visit my lab for 3-6 months, please read my letter to international visitors.
