    bio: |
      Marcela Resultay-Tayaba is a member of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians
      and serves as the Habitat Restoration Specialist for her tribe. Marcela obtained
      a bachelor’s degree in environmental sciences with an emphasis on Ecological
      Restoration as well as minors in Forestry and Natural Resources from Cal Poly
      Humboldt.
      Since graduating she has returned to work for her tribe’s Environmental Department
      and has dedicated her efforts to the revitalization of her ancestral language and
      traditional food practices. She hopes to inspire tribal youth and others to connect and
      honor nature through traditional practices and bringing tribal community together for
      cultural burning, and land/water conservation.
      Marcela’s main role is to oversee the implementation of restoration projects lead by
      state, federal, and private agencies. She is also responsible for
      grant management, overseeing the tribal community garden and managing various
      Clean Water Act projects on tribal land.
      It is important to her that every project incorporates culture, revitalizes traditional
      practices, provides education to the public, and provides Native youth the opportunity to
      learn and take ownership and pride in restoring our lands.
