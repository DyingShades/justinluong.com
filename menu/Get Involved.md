GRASS-Net aims to develop and share effective climate-resilient practices, facilitate seed exchanges for hard-to-access species, and develop coordinated strategies to increase plant diversity in restoration with practitioners involved in restoration projects.

GRASS-Net developed this survey for California grassland restoration practitioners to help establish a network in coordinating grassland restoration activities and sharing restoration knowledge and practices.

If you do practice grassland restoration in CA and you have input, we would love to hear from you! You can fill out our GRASS-Net survey for restoration practitioners here. Get connected with other restoration practitioners, use our climate smart species selection toolbox for your next restoration project, or take our survey to share your thoughts!
_Please take the survey if you have implemented or planned any grassland restoration projects (not research)._

Recent research found that restoration of California grasslands typically focuses on only 7 key perennial species across the entire coast.
