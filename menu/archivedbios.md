            I am a post-baccalaureate student in the Rangeland Resource Science program at Cal Poly Humboldt. Prior to returning to school, I worked as a sustainability consultant where I learned about resource management in the built environment. While working on large-scale waste management studies I became interested in learning about natural resource management. While pursuing my second bachelor’s degree I interned for NRCS Idaho and competed on the Collegiate Soil Judging team. My research project is focused on understanding the ecological conditions which may influence _Pleuropogon hooverianus_ development.

            Hi! My name is Hazel Goode. I am a Botany Student minoring in Wildland Soils in my final year at Humboldt. I grew up in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas and have always loved being outside. I became interested in rangelands working alongside a Rangeland Specialist/ Botanist for the Tahoe National Forest and have come to deeply appreciate their beauty and diversity. In my free time I love to kayak, create art, and spend time in the woods. My favorite gramminoid is _Carex utriculata_!

            Hi, I am Ashley and I'm a Rangeland Resource Science major with a Minor in Botany. Some of my hobbies include enjoying anything outdoors including foraging, hiking, camping, and pressing plants. I also really enjoy journaling, scrapbooking/creating collages, and thrifting. In the future it would be really cool work in land conservation/ and or conducting plant surveys for government agencies. I have a passion for plants and I really enjoy learning new plant species everyday.

            Hello, I'm Derek!  I'm a junior at CPH, majoring in Forestry and Soils.  I grew up on a raspberry farm in Bellingham, WA and managed the family business for a decade before moving to Humboldt County to pursue an education in natural resources.  I have a particular interest in forest-grassland transition zones, conifer encroachment throughout the PNW, and subalpine plant communities.  I'm really grateful to be part of such an ecologically minded community in one of the most beautiful and biodiverse places on the planet. Outside of school I enjoy hiking, photography, and writing music. My favorite grass is _Hesperostipa comata_ and favorite tree is _Tsuga mertensiana_.

            Hello my name is Tyvone Wilkey-Burrell but my friends call me Ty. I am currently a sophomore at Cal Poly Humboldt and my major is Forestry (Wildland and Fire Management). I also currently have two jobs on campus so if you ever happen to be in Nelson Hall come stop by The Umoja center located on the second floor and say hi. Finally in my free time I like to explore places I haven't been, go to the beach, and hangout with friends.
